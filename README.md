# Plant-Seedlings-Image-Classification-using-CNNs-in-Keras
Using the dataset of  images of  plant seedlings at various stages of  grown create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species.  Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 12 plant species. 
Objective:To implement the techniques learnt as a part of the course.Learning Outcomes:Pre-processing of image data.Visualization of images.Building CNN.Evaluate the Model.The motive of the project is to make the learners capable to handle images/image classification problems, during this process you shouldalso be capable to handle real image files, not just limited to a numpy array of image pixels.Guide to solve the project seamlessly:Here are the points which will help you to solve the problem efficiently:Read  the  problem  statement  carefully  from  start  to  end  (including  the  note  at  the  end).  The  highlighted  part  in  the attached problem statement should not be missed.Download the dataset from the Olympus platform.Upload the "images.npy"and “Labels.csv” file togoogle drive.Then  you  can  use  the  dataset  path  in  the  Google  Colab  notebook  to  do  further  steps  related  to  project  problem statement.You can set runtime type to “GPU” in Google Colab, so that the code will run fasteras you will be using CNN to fit your model.
